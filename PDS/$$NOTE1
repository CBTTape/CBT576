Sam,

I have changed XCPY so that it will now handle uncataloged
datasets.  This meant a small change to the panel but I think it
now makes more sense - the source dataset is now first, followed
by the destination dataset.

XCPY works exactly as it did before but with additional
functionality.  You can invoke the panel using an uncataloged
dataset and then enter a VOLSER for that dataset.  XCPY will then
retrieve the details and let you continue as normal.

XCPY when invoked from the command line is now a little different
as well.  It will work as it did before, but if you substitute
<volume:dsname> for <dsname>, it will strip the volume from the
dsname and populate the panel for you.  This should work for both
the source and destination datasets.

I have updated the doco, but it is probably best to just let you
play with it.

Tell me how you go !

Regards,

Mick Sheehy.
