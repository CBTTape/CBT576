//***FILE 576 is from Mick Sheehy, and contains a REXX exec which   *   FILE 576
//*           makes it very easy to copy sequential and pds files   *   FILE 576
//*           on MVS.  The package consists of one REXX exec and    *   FILE 576
//*           one ISPF panel.  When you decide to copy a dataset    *   FILE 576
//*           and execute the REXX, the panel appears and allows    *   FILE 576
//*           you to change all kinds of information about the      *   FILE 576
//*           target dataset, including its name, target volser,    *   FILE 576
//*           and space allocation.  If the target dataset space    *   FILE 576
//*           allocation is too small, then the program informs     *   FILE 576
//*           you, and requests that you allocate more space, even  *   FILE 576
//*           before any actual action is taken.                    *   FILE 576

//*           You'll enjoy the wholesome Aussie flavour of the      *   FILE 576
//*           dialog messages.                                      *   FILE 576
