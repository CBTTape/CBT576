XCPY retrieves the attributes of a dataset via the REXX TSO/E
external function LISTDSI.

This information is then used to populate a panel which when
displayed, allows the user the ability to change dataset
attributes. (eg. Space allocations, destination volume etc..)

These attributes are then fed into a TSO ALLOCATE command. Based
on the success of this command, IEBGENER or IEBCOPY is then
invoked to copy sequential datasets or PDS's respectively.

XCPY contains rudimentary validation which ensures the
destination dataset is large enough to hold the contents of the
original.  This is based on the space allocated and NOT the space
utilised.  XCPY will also ensure datasets are fully qualified
even though I am one of those strange individuals who works with
TSO with a profile containing "NOPREFIX"

**********************************************
**  IN SUMMARY BEFORE XCPY CAN BE INVOKED.  **
**********************************************

 - XCPY REXX must be placed within the SYSEXEC concatenation.
 - XCPY panel may either :
     ~ Be placed in the panel library concatenation and the
       LIBDEF statement in the XCPY REXX be deleted or commented
       out.
          OR
     ~ Be placed wherever the LIBDEF statement references.


To invoke XCPY :
 - Type XCPY next to a DSLIST dataset entry, the XCPY panel will
   be displayed and the user can enter a destination dataset,
   change any required attributes and hit <enter> to proceed.

     OR

 - Type XCPY <original dataset> <destination dataset> from the
   TSO command line.  This will display the XCPY panel with both
   the original and destination datasets already filled in. The
   user can then change any required attributes and hit <enter>
   to proceed.

 - Type XCPY <volume1:original dataset> <volume2:destination
   dataset> from the TSO command line.  This will display the
   XCPY panel with both the original and destination datasets
   already filled in.  In addition to this, the volumes on which
   these datasets reside will also be filled in.

   BY SPECIFYING THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE ORIGINAL DATASET
   RESIDES, XCPY IS ABLE TO COPY UNCATALOGED DATASETS.

I find this utility extremely handy - I hope others do to !
